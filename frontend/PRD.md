# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Product Vision:** A mobile-friendly onboarding flow that guides new Farm Easy users through a 4-step setup process to personalize their AI farm assistant experience, collecting essential farm information to enable tailored agricultural guidance.

**Core Purpose:** Streamline the initial setup experience for farmers by collecting critical farm data (location, crops, farm details, preferences) in an intuitive, touch-friendly interface that works seamlessly on mobile devices.

**Target Users:** New farmers signing up for Farm Easy who need to configure their AI farm assistant with their specific farm information.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-step onboarding wizard with 4 distinct steps - Configuration/System

- Crop selection interface with multi-select capability - User-Generated Content
- Farm details collection (soil type, irrigation, size) - User-Generated Content
- Language and interaction preference settings - Configuration/System
- Progress tracking and success confirmation - System

**Complexity Assessment:** Simple
- **State Management:** Local (client-side form state, localStorage)
- **External Integrations:** 1 (GPS/geolocation API - browser native)
- **Business Logic:** Simple (form validation, data collection, API submission)
- **Data Synchronization:** None (one-time setup flow)

**MVP Success Metrics:**
- Users can complete all 4 onboarding steps without errors
- Farm setup data successfully saves to backend via API
- Users are redirected to dashboard after completion
- Onboarding flow works on mobile devices (touch-friendly)

## 3. USER WORKFLOWS

### 3.1 Primary Workflow: Complete Farm Onboarding

**Trigger:** New user logs into Farm Easy for the first time or existing user without completed setup

**Outcome:** User's farm is fully configured with location, crops, farm details, and preferences; user is redirected to dashboard ready to use AI assistant

**Steps:**
1. User logs into Farm Easy web app
2. System detects incomplete/missing farm setup
3. System displays onboarding welcome screen with "Get Started" button
4. User clicks "Get Started"
5. System displays Step 1: Farm Location with progress indicator (1 of 4)
6. User chooses GPS location option
7. System requests location permission
8. User grants permission
9. System captures GPS coordinates and displays location on map
10. System automatically determines county/region
11. User reviews location preview and clicks "Next"
12. System validates location data and displays Step 2: Crop Selection (2 of 4)
13. User taps multiple crop chips to select crops they grow
14. User clicks "Next"
15. System validates at least one crop selected and displays Step 3: Farm Details (3 of 4)
16. User selects soil type from dropdown
17. User selects irrigation method from dropdown
18. User enters farm size and selects unit (acres/hectares)
19. User clicks "Next"
20. System validates all three fields completed and displays Step 4: Preferences (4 of 4)
21. User selects preferred language
22. User selects interaction mode (voice or text)
23. User clicks "Finish"
24. System compiles all data into JSON format
25. System submits POST request to /api/setup
26. API processes and saves farm setup data
27. System receives success response
28. System stores setup data in localStorage
29. System displays success screen with "Welcome Farmer" message
30. System automatically redirects to /dashboard after 2-3 seconds
31. User arrives at dashboard with farm setup complete

**Alternative Paths:**
- **If user chooses manual location entry:** User interacts with map interface to select location by tapping/dragging marker
- **If GPS permission denied:** System shows manual entry option with helpful message
- **If user clicks "Back" on any step:** System returns to previous step with previously entered data preserved
- **If API submission fails:** System displays error message with "Retry" button, preserves entered data
- **If user closes browser mid-onboarding:** System can optionally save progress (deferred feature) or restart onboarding on next login

### 3.2 Entity Management Workflows

**Farm Setup Configuration Management Workflow**

**Create Farm Setup:**
1. User navigates through 4-step onboarding wizard
2. User enters location in Step 1
3. User selects crops in Step 2
4. User enters farm details in Step 3
5. User sets preferences in Step 4
6. User clicks "Finish"
7. System submits data to API
8. System confirms creation with success screen

**Edit Farm Setup:** (During onboarding only)
1. User is on any step 2-4 of onboarding
2. User clicks "Back" button
3. System returns to previous step
4. User modifies previously entered information
5. User clicks "Next" to proceed forward
6. System saves updated information

**Delete Farm Setup:** Not allowed during onboarding
- Reason: Onboarding is a one-time setup flow; deletion/reset would be handled in settings post-onboarding (deferred feature)

**View Farm Setup:**
1. User completes onboarding
2. System stores data in localStorage
3. User navigates to dashboard
4. Dashboard components read farm setup from localStorage
5. User sees personalized content based on their farm configuration

## 4. BUSINESS RULES

### Entity Lifecycle Rules:

**Farm Setup Configuration:**
- **Who can create:** Any authenticated new user without completed setup
- **Who can view:** Owner only (the user who created the setup)
- **Who can edit:** Owner only, during onboarding flow via "
