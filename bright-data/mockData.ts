    "geographic_context": "The 95926 zip code is located in Chico, Butte County, within California's Sacramento Valley. This region is characterized by fertile alluvial soils and a Mediterranean climate.",
    "climate_summary": "Chico experiences hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Average annual rainfall is approximately 25-28 inches. The long growing season is highly favorable for a wide range of crops.",
    "soil_summary": "Soils in Butte County are generally fertile, well-drained alluvial loams, clay loams, and silty loams, suitable for diverse agricultural production. Specific areas may have heavier clay soils ideal for rice.",
    "market_overview": "California is a global leader in agricultural production. The Sacramento Valley, including Butte County, is a significant contributor, particularly for tree nuts and rice. Market demand for these commodities, both domestic and international, drives profitability. Water availability and cost are critical factors influencing crop choice and profitability in the region."

      "reason": "The Sacramento Valley is California's primary rice-growing region, with specific clay soils and historical water rights making it highly suitable. While requiring substantial water, it's a staple crop with a strong, established market.",
      "suitability_factors": "Requires specific heavy clay soils for water retention and significant water for flood irrigation. Specialized equipment and processing infrastructure are well-established in the region."

      "yield_estimate": "1,500 - 3,000 lbs/acre (in-shell)",
      "reason": "While traditionally more common further south, pistachio cultivation is expanding into suitable areas of the northern Sacramento Valley. They are highly drought-tolerant once established and command very high market prices due to strong demand.",
      "suitability_factors": "Tolerant of hot, dry summers and less demanding of water than some other nuts once mature. Requires well-drained soils and a long, hot growing season."

      "reason": "California is the leading producer of processing tomatoes. The fertile soils and long, warm growing season of the Sacramento Valley are ideal. Often grown under contract, providing a reliable, though generally lower, per-acre return compared to tree nuts.",
      "suitability_factors": "Requires fertile, well-drained soils and a long, warm growing season. Typically grown under contract with processors, ensuring a market."
    }
