# Backend Logging Design

## 1. Logging Library Recommendation

For this project, we recommend using **Winston**, a versatile and popular logging library for Node.js. It offers a great deal of flexibility and is well-suited for a TypeScript environment.

**Key advantages of Winston:**

*   **Multiple Transports:** Winston can log to various destinations, including the console, files, and external services.
*   **Customizable Formatting:** It allows for highly flexible log formatting to meet specific project needs.
*   **Good Performance:** While not the absolute fastest, its performance is more than adequate for most applications.

## 2. Log Format

Logs will be formatted in JSON for easy parsing and querying. Each log entry will contain the following fields:

*   `timestamp`: The ISO 8601 timestamp of the log entry.
*   `level`: The log level (e.g., `info`, `warn`, `error`).
*   `logger`: The name of the logger (e.g., `auth`, `database`).
*   `message`: A detailed description of the log event.

**Example Log Entry:**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z",
  "level": "info",
  "logger": "server",
  "message": "Server started on port 3000"
}
```

## 3. Log Storage

Logs will be stored in a `logs` directory at the root of the `backend` directory. To prevent log files from growing too large, a new log file will be created each day.

*   **Log Directory:** `backend/logs`
*   **Log Filename Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD.log` (e.g., `2023-10-27.log`)

This naming convention will make it easy to locate logs for a specific date.
